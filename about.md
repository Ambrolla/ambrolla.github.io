I will be adding (and probably revising) more things within April, 2022.

But a little bit about me:

- I'm a web developer enthusiast.
- I love coffee and cats (and dogs, but I only have a cat right now).
- I love reading. If I have to wait for something or someone, I will never be bored because I will always have a book somewhere nearby.
