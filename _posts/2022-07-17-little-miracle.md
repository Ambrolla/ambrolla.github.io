Hello everyone!

So, a miracle did happen. Only not the one I expected to happen.
I found a part-time job in a very small startup... That's not located in USA. At first, I thought that why not, I'll get an experience, it will be fun considering that it's a part-time position. One of the good things is that I get to learn Typescript, which I've never touched before joining this startups. That's why I suddenly have less commits on my github, by the way. However, I'm realizing that at this point of my career, a small startup is a challenge and not something I'm ready for yet.

The other miracle happen is that I did get an offer for a full time position as an intern/trainee... A month ago with no start date of when will I start working. I will write more details about this in a separate post once I'll start working if I will.

So, I'm still exploring new opportunities and hoping to find a place where I would be a good fit.
